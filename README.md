# PoewerBi-Hr-Analysis-Dashboard
**Objective**
The goal of this project is to support an organization in enhancing employee performance and reducing attrition by developing an "HR Analytics Dashboard." This dashboard delivers critical insights into employee data, enabling data-driven decisions that foster employee satisfaction and retention.

**Data Source**
The raw dataset, consisting of 38 columns and approximately 1,500 rows, was provided in CSV format. It contained a variety of information, including employee demographics, job roles, salaries, tenure, and more.

**Data Processing and Cleaning**
Several steps were taken to ensure the data was ready for analysis:

**Null and duplicate values were removed.**
Spelling errors were corrected, and appropriate data types were assigned.
An additional column was created for attrition, assigning a value of 0 for "no" and 1 for "yes" based on the attrition status.
A new metric, attrition rate, was calculated using the formula:
Attrition Rate = (Total Attrition Count / Total Employee Count)
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
The following KPIs were identified to track and evaluate employee performance and attrition, with corresponding visualizations created in Power BI:

Employee Count
Attrition
Attrition Rate
Average Age
Average Salary
Average Tenure
Charts and Insights
Various charts and visualizations were used to derive meaningful insights from the employee data. Key insights include:

**Treemap Chart**: Showed the distribution of attrition by gender. The data revealed that 136 males and 76 females left the company, indicating a higher attrition rate among male employees.

**Pie Chart:** Displayed attrition count by education field.
Stacked Column Chart: Revealed that the 26-35 age group had the highest attrition count, with 111 employees leaving the company.

**Matrix Table:** Showcased job roles alongside job satisfaction scores, with significant values highlighted in blue.

**Funnel Chart:** Illustrated attrition count by monthly salary ranges.

**Area Chart:** Displayed attrition trends based on years with the company.

**Conclusion**
This HR Analytics Dashboard provides vital insights into employee trends that can drive better decision-making, improve employee satisfaction, and enhance retention. By addressing key issues affecting employees and fostering a positive work environment, the organization can promote better performance and long-term employee engagement.
